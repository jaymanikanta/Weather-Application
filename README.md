# Weather-Application
A weather application that fetches weather data from Wunderground API and styled with Bootstrap 4 and Unsplash.it API
## How does it look like?

![Main Screen](https://github.com/jaymanikanta/Weather-Application/blob/master/mainscreen.JPG)

## How did you build it?
Simple, I used plain vanilla javascript to fetch data from Wunderground API for weather and Unsplash.it for a random background image that changes everytime you refresh the page. The UI is completely built using Bootstrap 4 because it's the most elegant solution for a single page web-app like this.
## Can I modify it?
Yes ofcourse. You can do whatever you want! ****Just remember to get your own API key from Wunderground and use it to substitute mine, Or else the app won't work.
